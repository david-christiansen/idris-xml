#+TITLE: Idris XML

A Simple XML library for Idris. It is a work in construction, so things will fail.


+ This library has been inspired by [[http://www.yesodweb.com/book/xml][=xml-conduit=]].
+ This library is not necessarily feature complete and will have missing functionality.
+ The Parser only parses simple xml documents.
  + The XPath implementation is very basic.
  + Name spaces are local only and prefix's are not parsed.
  + The XML declaration is not intelligent and checks for root element name is not performed.
+ The DOM model is simple.
+ Things I would like to have but not necessarily the time for include:
  + Tests!
  + Add Eq instance, may need to add shapes
  + QuasiQuotes idiomatic construction of documents within Idris.
    + Something more consice than the dom model.
  + Full implementation of XPath, or Cursor, or XQuery
  + XSD validation.
  + Better Soundness guarantees
    + using dependenty types
    + wrt xmlnode
  + XSLT transformation processing.
+ There are most likely things I would like to include but don't knwo that I need to include. If you know about this please consider contributing.
