#+TITLE: Idris XML

*There is a bug* and rhe parser has stopped recognising elements properly. I do not know that has changed. Fixes may come later.

A Simple XML library for Idris.

+ This library has been inspired by [[http://www.yesodweb.com/book/xml][=xml-conduit=]].
+ This library is not necessarily feature complete and will have missing functionality.
+ The Parser only parses simple xml documents.
  + Name spaces are local only and prefix's are not parsed.
  + The XML declaration is not intelligent and checks for root element name is not performed.
+ Things I would like to have but not necessarily the time for include:
  + Soundness guarantees wrt xmlnode
  + Cursor/XPath query functionality
  + XSD validation.
  + QuasiQuotes idiomatic construction of documents within Idris.
  + XSLT transformation processing.
+ There are most likely things I would like to include but don't knwo that I need to include. If you know about this please consider contributing.
